            Trying to be a better nerd every day. I love Linux and yes, I use
            Arch by the way.

            </a>, made with pure nerd vibes. It was a great experience to code
            them up ahh, those endless bugs, endless tantrums of “why doesn't it

            I strive to do the same in my life: live fully, gain knowledge, and
            have fun ! I hope to turn this place more beautiful someday.

            Oh, let’s talk about Root Daemons. They are privileged processes
            running in the shadows… Those Daemons have absolute powers, of
            course, with responsibilities kinda like me :)

            Beyond the terminal, I love cooking, playing badminton, working out,
            and being lazy sometimes.
